Works for both file names and content.\n                        - earlyTermination: Stop search early when exact filename match is found (optional: defaults to true for file searches, false for content searches)\n                        \n                        DECISION EXAMPLES:\n                        - \"find package.json\" → searchType=\"files\", pattern=\"package.json\" (specific file)\n                        - \"find authentication components\" → searchType=\"content\", pattern=\"authentication\" (looking for functionality)\n                        - \"locate all React components\" → searchType=\"files\", pattern=\"*.tsx\" or \"*.jsx\" (file pattern)\n                        - \"find TODO comments\" → searchType=\"content\", pattern=\"TODO\" (text in files)\n                        - \"show me login files\" → AMBIGUOUS → run both: files with \"login\" AND content with \"login\"\n                        - \"find config\" → AMBIGUOUS → run both: config files AND files containing config code\n                        \n                        COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH EXAMPLES:\n                        - Find package.json files: searchType=\"files\", pattern=\"package.json\"\n                        - Find all JS files: searchType=\"files\", pattern=\"*.js\"\n                        - Search for TODO in code: searchType=\"content\", pattern=\"TODO\", filePattern=\"*.js|*.ts\"\n                        - Search for exact code: searchType=\"content\", pattern=\"toast.error('test')\", literalSearch=true\n                        - Ambiguous request \"find auth stuff\": Run two searches:\n                          1. searchType=\"files\", pattern=\"auth\"\n                          2. searchType=\"content\", pattern=\"authentication\"\n                        \n                        PRO TIP: When user requests are ambiguous about whether they want files or content,\n                        run both searches concurrently and combine results for comprehensive coverage.\n                        \n                        Unlike regular search tools, this starts a background search process and returns\n                        immediately with a session ID. Use get_more_search_results to get results as they\n                        come in, and stop_search to stop the search early if needed.\n                        \n                        Perfect for large directories where you want to see results immediately and\n                        have the option to cancel if the search takes too long or you find what you need.\n                        \n                        IMPORTANT: Always use absolute paths for reliability. Paths are automatically normalized regardless of slash direction. Relative paths may fail as they depend on the current working directory. Tilde paths (~/...) might not work in all contexts. Unless the user explicitly asks for relative paths, use absolute paths.\n                        This command can be referenced as \"DC: ...\" or \"use Desktop Commander to ...\" in your instructions.",
